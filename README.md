# Python Programming

**Welcome to the World of Python!**

This is an introductory course in Python, with Jupyter Notebook as the User Interface (IDE), prepared by [Sourav Sen Gupta](http://www.souravsengupta.com/).

Python is a fun language to learn, and really easy to pick up even if you are new to programming. In fact, quite often, Python is easier to pick up if you do not have any programming experience whatsoever. Python is a high level language, targeted at students and professionals from diverse backgrounds. It offers an amazing array of [Useful Libraries](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules) too.

Python has two flavors -- Python 2 and Python 3. This set of examples are in Python 3, written and executed in the beautifully simple IDE Jupyter Notebook. Note that Jupyter sets up a `localhost:8888` server to render the notebook in your computer's browser. It can render anything thereafter -- should be fun! Once you are familiar with the Jupyter Notebook environment, and the basic Python syntax in [Module 0](Module0_TheNotebook.ipynb), feel free to explore the rest of the Python Modules.

> [Module 0](Module0_TheNotebook.ipynb) : Python in Jupyter Notebook   
> [Module 1](Module1_DataTypes.ipynb) : Basic Data Types in Python  
> [Module 2](Module2_DataStructures.ipynb) : Data Structures in Python   
> [Module 3](Module3_ConditionLoop.ipynb) : Conditions and Loops in Python   
> [Module 4](Module4_Functions.ipynb) : Functions and Modules in Python   
> [Module 5](Module5_PythonComputing.ipynb) : Computing with Python   
> [Module 6](Module6_DataHandling.ipynb) : Data Handling with Python   
> [Module 7](Module7_BasicDataScience.ipynb) : Basic Data Science in Python   
> [Module 8](Module8_ObjectOrientedPython.ipynb) : Classes and Objects in Python   
> [Module X](ModuleX_MiscellaneousTopics.ipynb) : Miscellaneous Topics in Python   
> [Problems](ProgrammingChallenges.ipynb) : Python Programming Challenges        
> [Solutions](ProgrammingSolutions.ipynb) : Python Programming Solutions

To get the most out of this crash course, you'll need to download and use the Jupyter Notebooks for individual Modules posted in this repository (or `git clone` the repository). Before that, prepare your computer by installing the following.

> Platform : Anaconda for Python 3.7 (https://www.anaconda.com/)     
> Core Engine : Python 3.7 (it will get installed with Anaconda)    
> User Interface (IDE) : Jupyter Notebook (comes with Anaconda)     

In case installing Anaconda for Python 3.7 is too heavy for you, and you know how to manage conda environments and packages, you may also download and install the MiniConda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) package for Python 3.7. It's lightweight, but you will have to install all required Data Science packages individually, on your own.

This set of introductory material for Python is heavily inspired from two wonderful lecture series in Python, as follows.

- Python4Maths by Andreas Ernst : https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/andrease/Python4Maths
- Python Lectures by Rajath Kumar : https://github.com/rajathkmp/Python-Lectures

**Highly recommended** : [Python 3 Cheat Sheet](pythonCheatSheet.pdf) by [Laurent Pointal](https://perso.limsi.fr/pointal/python:memento). This 2-pager is a life-saver -- print and frame it!
