    "\n",
    "Python is a fun language to learn, and really easy to pick up even if you are new to programming. In fact, quite often, Python is easier to pick up if you do not have any programming experience whatsoever. Python is high level programming language, targeted at students and professionals from diverse backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of examples are in Python 3, written and executed in the beautifully simple IDE Jupyter Notebook. You may either use the Jupyter Notebook interface or Google Colab to view, edit and execute this notebook. As Notebooks are rendered in the browser as web applications, they can support a wide range of frontend elements, including cells (code and markdown), graphics, animation and interactivity. Note that Jupyter initializes a local server running python at the backend (on your own computer), and renders the frontend through a Notebook environment at `localhost:8888`. Keep the backend server (generally runs on your terminal for Linux/Mac or Anaconda Prompt for Windows) running so that the frontend notebook interface can access Python. \n",

    "Once you are familiar with the Notebook environment, and the basic Python syntax on this page, feel free to explore the other Chapters in this repository.\n",
